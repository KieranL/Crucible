A miniature version of the Voron Stealthburner toolhead for use with the LGX Lite extruder.

Part cooling fans are intended to pull air from around the hotend. Testing will tell whether or not this stays. 

Supports Dragon at the moment - more to come. 

*There are two versions of the cowling - one for 3007 hotend fan and another for 3010.
